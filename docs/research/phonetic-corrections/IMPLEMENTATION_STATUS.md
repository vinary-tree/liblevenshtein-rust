# Generalized Operations Framework: Implementation Status

**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Last Updated**: 2026-06-19 (UTF-8 multi-character substitution support verified)
**Status**: 🟢 **CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Framework, Phase 1 phonetics, UTF-8 multi-character substitutions, and direct matching APIs are implemented

---

## Summary

The generalized operations framework from TCS 2011 has been successfully implemented, along with **Phase 1 phonetic operations**. The core infrastructure (`OperationType`, `OperationSet`, `SubstitutionSet`) is fully functional with multi-character support. English phonetic corrections are now available through the `phonetic` module, providing ~60% coverage of common phonetic transformations.

**What works now:**
- ✅ Generalized operations framework (operation triples with restrictions)
- ✅ Multi-character substitution matching (2→1, 1→2, 2→2)
- ✅ Phase 1 phonetic operations (consonant digraphs, clusters, confusions, doubles)
- ✅ Backward compatibility layer (Algorithm → OperationSet)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (50+ tests, 100% passing)

**Remaining integration boundaries:**
- Universal automata integration is a separate architecture track.
- End-to-end phonetic string matching is available through the phonetic automata/rule-stack APIs; OperationSet-driven universal transition integration remains separate.
- Runtime transition specialization needs benchmark-driven evaluation before replacing existing specialized hot paths.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: OperationType Core (Commit: ec31ede)

**File**: `src/transducer/operation_type.rs` (507 lines)

✅ **Implemented**:
- Operation triple: `⟨consume_x, consume_y, weight⟩`
- Support for restricted operations with `SubstitutionSet`
- Enforces Theorem 8.2 constraints (bounded diagonal property)
- Methods: `new()`, `with_restriction()`, `can_apply()`, `is_match()`, etc.
- 7 tests, all passing

**Example**:
```rust
// Standard match operation
let match_op = OperationType::new(1, 1, 0.0, "match");

// Custom weighted operation for OCR
let ocr_op = OperationType::new(1, 1, 0.2, "ocr_o_zero");

// Phonetic digraph through real multi-character storage
let mut phonetic = SubstitutionSet::new();
phonetic.allow_str("ph", "f");
let ph_op = OperationType::with_restriction(2, 1, 0.15, phonetic, "ph_to_f");
```

---

### Phase 2: OperationSet and Builder (Commit: 48884cd)

**File**: `src/transducer/operation_set.rs` (620 lines)

✅ **Implemented**:
- `OperationSet`: Container for collections of `OperationType` instances
- `OperationSetBuilder`: Fluent API for building operation sets
- Standard operation presets:
  - `OperationSet::standard()` - Match, Substitute, Insert, Delete
  - `OperationSet::with_transposition()` - Standard + Transposition
  - `OperationSet::with_merge_split()` - Standard + Merge + Split
- Complete iteration and mutation APIs
- 10 tests, all passing

**Example**:
```rust
// Build custom operation set
let ops = OperationSetBuilder::new()
    .with_match()
    .with_substitution()
    .with_insertion()
    .with_deletion()
    .with_transposition()
    .build();

// Or use presets
let ops = OperationSet::with_transposition();
```

---

### Phase 3: Backward Compatibility Layer (Commit: c826a6c)

**File**: `src/transducer/algorithm.rs` (+84 lines)

✅ **Implemented**:
- `Algorithm::to_operation_set()` - Explicit conversion method
- `From<Algorithm> for OperationSet` - Implicit conversion trait
- Maps all three enum variants:
  - `Standard` → 4 operations
  - `Transposition` → 5 operations
  - `MergeAndSplit` → 6 operations
- 4 new tests, all 7 algorithm tests passing

**Example**:
```rust
// Explicit conversion
let ops = Algorithm::Standard.to_operation_set();

// Implicit conversion
let ops: OperationSet = Algorithm::Transposition.into();
```

## Current Capability And Remaining Work

### Critical Path Items

#### 1. Multi-Character SubstitutionSet Storage

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**
**Evidence**: `src/transducer/substitution_set.rs`; regression coverage includes `test_multi_char_utf8_substitutions`
**Files**: `src/transducer/substitution_set.rs`

**Current State**:
- `SubstitutionSet::allow_str()` stores ASCII, UTF-8, and multi-character pairs.
- `SubstitutionSet::contains_str()` checks optimized single-byte storage first and multi-character storage for longer or UTF-8 pairs.
- `has_source()` and `has_target_starting_with()` include multi-character storage.
- Single-byte ASCII pairs still use optimized byte storage.
- Multi-character pairs use a small-vector representation that upgrades to a hash map for larger sets.

**Implemented Representation**:
```rust
pub struct SubstitutionSet {
    byte_table: /* optimized single-byte representation */,
    multi_char: MultiCharSubstitutionImpl,
}

impl SubstitutionSet {
    pub fn allow_str(&mut self, a: &str, b: &str) {
        // ASCII one-byte pairs use byte storage.
        // UTF-8 and multi-character pairs use string storage.
    }

    pub fn contains_str(&self, a: &[u8], b: &[u8]) -> bool {
        // Fast-path single-byte lookup, then multi-character lookup.
    }
}
```

---

#### 2. Universal Automata Integration

**Status**: 🟡 **SEPARATE ARCHITECTURE TRACK**
**Effort**: 3-4 weeks (complex)
**Files**: `src/transducer/universal/*`

**Current State**:
- Universal automata use compile-time specialized variants (`PositionVariant` trait)
- Transition logic is hardcoded in `successors()` method
- Works with single-character operations only
- Bit-vector encoding assumes single-character consumption

**Required for OperationSet-Driven Universal Integration**:
1. **Runtime-based transition system**:
   - Accept `OperationSet` as parameter
   - Data-driven transition logic instead of compile-time specialization

2. **Multi-character operation support**:
   - Redesign characteristic vector representation to handle variable-length consumption
   - Modify bit-vector encoding: `β(x, s_n(w,i))` for multi-char lookahead

3. **New transition function** `δ^∀,χ_n(Q, x, ops)`:
   - Iterate over operations in `OperationSet`
   - Apply each operation's `can_apply()` predicate
   - Generate successor positions based on `consume_x` and `consume_y`

4. **Subsumption updates**:
   - Verify subsumption checks work with multi-char positions
   - Update diagonal bounds based on operation set (not just variant)

**Architecture Challenge**:
The current `PositionVariant` trait provides **compile-time specialization** for performance. Switching to runtime `OperationSet` would require either:
- **Option A**: Monomorphization per operation set (template specialization)
- **Option B**: Dynamic dispatch with performance overhead
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach (compile-time for standard, runtime for custom)

### Phase 1 Phonetic Operations

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - 2025-11-12
**Effort**: ~1 day (actual)
**Files**: `src/transducer/phonetic.rs` (420 lines)

**Implemented**:
- `phonetic_english_basic()` comprehensive preset
- `consonant_digraphs()`: ch↔k, sh↔s, ph↔f, th↔t, qu↔kw (ASCII-only, bidirectional)
  - 3 operations: 2→1, 1→2, 2→2
- `initial_clusters()`: wr↔r, wh↔w, kn↔n, ps↔s, pn↔n, gn↔n, rh↔r (bidirectional)
  - 2 operations: 2→1, 1→2
- `phonetic_confusions()`: c↔k, c↔s, s↔z, g↔j, f↔v, a↔e, i↔e
  - 1 operation: 1→1 (symmetric)
- `double_consonants()`: bb↔b, dd↔d, ff↔f, etc. (14 consonants)
  - 1 operation: 2→1 (bidirectional)
- 10 tests, all passing

**Coverage**: ~60% of common English phonetic transformations (ASCII-only variant)

**Design Notes**:
- Used ASCII substitutes (k, s, f, t) instead of special phonetic characters (ç, $, +)
- Bidirectional mappings for maximum flexibility
- Weight hierarchy: doubles (0.10) < digraphs (0.15) < clusters (0.20) < confusions (0.25)
- Modular design: separate functions for each phonetic category
- Total: 7 operations in `phonetic_english_basic()` preset

---

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation

- **OperationType**: 40-56 bytes per operation (depending on restriction set)
- **OperationSet**: `Vec<OperationType>` - inline for ≤4 operations, heap for >4
- **SubstitutionSet**: Hybrid Vec/HashSet (linear scan for ≤4 pairs, hash for >4)

### Multi-Char Substitution Impact

Estimated memory overhead for phonetic operations:
- Consonant digraphs: 8 pairs × ~32 bytes = ~256 bytes
- Vowel digraphs: ~15 pairs × ~32 bytes = ~480 bytes
- Trigraphs: ~3 pairs × ~40 bytes = ~120 bytes
- **Total**: ~1 KB per phonetic operation set

### Transition Performance

Current (compile-time specialized):
- Standard: ~50-100 ns per transition
- Transposition: ~80-150 ns per transition

Expected (runtime with OperationSet):
- With monomorphization: Similar (0-10% overhead)
- With dynamic dispatch: +20-40% overhead
- With multi-char operations: +30-60% overhead (due to variable-length matching)

---

## Migration Path for Users

### Current Code (Old API)
```rust
use liblevenshtein::transducer::{Algorithm, UniversalAutomaton};

let automaton = UniversalAutomaton::<Standard>::new(2);
```

### New Code (OperationSet API)
```rust
use liblevenshtein::transducer::{OperationSet, UniversalAutomaton};

let ops = OperationSet::standard();
let automaton = UniversalAutomaton::new(2, &ops);
```

### Backward Compatible (Using conversion)
```rust
use liblevenshtein::transducer::{Algorithm, OperationSet};

let ops: OperationSet = Algorithm::Standard.into();
// Old code continues to work via From<Algorithm> trait
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Design universal automata integration architecture**
   - Analyze trade-offs between compile-time and runtime approaches
   - Create detailed design document before implementation
   - Consider hybrid approach for backward compatibility

2. **Document current OperationSet integration boundaries** in API docs
   - State that multi-character restrictions are implemented
   - Distinguish direct phonetic/rule-stack APIs from OperationSet-driven universal automata integration

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Incremental integration**:
   - Phase 1: Multi-char `SubstitutionSet` ✅
   - Phase 2: Runtime operation matching (without automata)
   - Phase 3: Universal automata integration
   - Phase 4: Full phonetic operations

2. **Performance validation at each phase**:
   - Benchmark before/after changes
   - Ensure no regression for existing use cases
   - Profile critical paths

3. **User communication**:
   - Mark APIs as experimental during transition
   - Provide migration guides
   - Deprecation warnings for old APIs (if needed)

## Conclusion

The generalized operations framework is **fully implemented** and **Phase 1 phonetic operations are complete**. The core abstractions (`OperationType`, `OperationSet`, `SubstitutionSet`) work correctly with multi-character operations. English phonetic corrections are now available through the `phonetic` module.

**Completed (2025-11-12):**
- ✅ Generalized operations framework (operations as triples)
- ✅ Multi-character substitution storage (hybrid Vec/HashMap)
- ✅ Phase 1 phonetic operations (4 categories, 7 operations, 10 tests)
- ✅ Backward compatibility (Algorithm → OperationSet conversion)

**Next Steps:**
The main blocker for **end-to-end phonetic matching** is universal automata integration. The current universal automata use compile-time specialization and need to be refactored to accept runtime `OperationSet` parameters. This is a 3-4 week architectural effort.

**Users can already:**
- Create custom operation sets with multi-character rules
- Use the phonetic operation presets
- Convert between Algorithm and OperationSet
- Test operations with `can_apply()`

**Actual usage for string matching** requires the universal automata integration (next major milestone).
